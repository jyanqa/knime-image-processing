This repository contains my first Python node, developed during the 2024 Schloss Week with KNIME in Paris.

It serves as an extension for post-processing the output from HF serverless models for object detection and object tracking tasks. I also wrote an article on this topic, showcasing its implementation using a KNIME workflow. The URL will be updated once the article is live!
